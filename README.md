# Concentration Game

## About The Project
This is the Second project in IOS course, which is part of my academic stuides.

## Improvments
1. Added Main screen which the user can select between easy and hard mode.
2. Added Top Ten screen which the user can view top 10 player.
3. Added user location and map view to display top 10 player their locations.

## Design principle 
In this project i implemented MVC architectural pattern to decouple the the logic from the view.

### View
      Display all the card using collection view.
### Model 
      Hold list of cards which the controller can fetch and let the view display the state of the model. 
### Controller
      Manage the interaction of the user with the collection view and the model.
